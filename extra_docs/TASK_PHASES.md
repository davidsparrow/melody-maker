# Melody Magic - Functional Features Development Task Phases

## PROJECT SUMMARY

**Melody Magic** is an AI-powered music generation platform that analyzes uploaded songs and generates complementary sections (intros, outros, bridges) using AI. The platform combines audio analysis (BPM, key, energy detection) with generative music APIs to create musically coherent sections that match existing tracks.

**Current Status**: Static landing page deployed on Vercel âœ…
**Goal**: Build full functional MVP with working audio upload, analysis, generation, and export capabilities

**Reference Documents**: 
- `melody-magic-overview.md` - MVP directory structures & architecture notes
- `melody-magic-architecture.md` - Detailed system architecture & user stories
